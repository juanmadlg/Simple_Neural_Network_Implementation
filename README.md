# Simple Neural Network implementation
This is the implementation of a simple Neural Network using plain Python without any ML framework (only Numpy)

## Motivation

Understand in a practical way how a Neural Network works: error function, backpropagation, etc.

This Notebook has been inspired by [this Siraj Raval repository](https://github.com/llSourcell/Make_a_neural_network) 
and [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ) 

## Version

v1.0.0.0 First version

## Python

The script has been developed in Python using the Google Colab Notebooks

## Usage

1. Upload the Colab file (.ipynb) to your Colaboratory folder 
2. Execute all steps of the Notebook

## Test
This project does not include tests.
